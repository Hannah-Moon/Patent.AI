Our Vision
Did you know you can own ideas, like how you might own a house? As a patent holder, you are recognized for your technical achievements and can generate passive income through licensing. We are building language-generation software that make drafting and filing patents as easy as registering a domain name. With our software, anyone can become an inventor by describing their idea in a few paragraphs. After filing for a patent, inventors can use our platform to monetize their patent portfolio by licensing and trading their assets in an online marketplace. Our overall roadmap by analogy is as follows:

Autodesk | Drafting tool for professionals
TurboTax | Legal automation for everyone
Amazon | All-in-one platform and marketplace
